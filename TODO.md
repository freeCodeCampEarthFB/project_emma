PROBLEM
================================================================================
Members blocked from the group can create a new account and submit a join 
request, anonymously re-entering the group, allowing them to continue to carry
out their campaign of disruptive behavior.



SOLUTION
================================================================================
A utility that captures the account creation date (identified by the "Joined 
Facebook on" line in their account preview that accompanies join requests) of 
all users on the member request list, and looks for admin activity on or around
the same time, outputting a list of those members whose accounts were created at
times that coincide with other accounts being removed, potentially revealing who
might be trying to get around being blocked.



IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================
TBD: Suggestions include a browser extension mods can install that scrape data
as the mod visits the member request list, or accessing the data through the
Facebook API



//TO DO
# Talk to anyone familiar with the Facebook API, social media bots, browser
# extensions, and choose the best course of action to proceed, and possible
# alternatives.
