DESCRIPTION
================================================================================
project_emma, named for freeCodeCamp Earth's former moderator, is the first 
group project for freeCodeCamp Earth, and it has a very special purpose:

Stopping trolls.

One of the challenges of having an open global community is everyone is welcome.
Sometimes this means letting in some people that aren't there to participate in 
any way that's helpful, and aren't there to learn. We want to continue to 
maintain our open door policy, but with tools that help identify problems before 
they interfere with the group.

So we came up with project_emma. This program identifies new member's account 
creation dates, and checks it against the group's Admin Activity report, and 
returns warnings for any account that's creation date coincides with an event, 
potentially (not definitely) identifying returning bad actors and troublemakers.

While use of this tool won't give us concrete cause to deny anyone entry into 
the group, it does warn the moderator team of possible attempts to re-enter the 
group under new accounts by users that were removed. Our hope is that with those 
potential bad actors flagged, we can watch for and respond faster to any trouble 
they may hope to cause.

At present, we find we are able to do this ourselves, when we mods add new 
members. We would like to have a computer handle this for us because it's 
repetative, mundane, and with the ever growing popularity of freeCodeCamp, 
increasingly time consuming.
